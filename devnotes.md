### Things I have learned

The colab html is a mess

* we want cells with classes `"cell text"` and `"cell text focused"`
* They are absolutely burried. 




### Local Testing in Chrome

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
1. Make sure "Developer Mode" is turned on
1. Select "Load unpacked extensions" and then our "extension" folder

The extension should automatically refresh on file updates.



### Documentation

1. Manifest v3 updates [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)
1. To deploy, go to the [chrome web store docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/)
